## Hi there 👋

- 😄 Pronouns: ... **Saffan** is pronounced like Stefan but without the "t" :)
- 📫 How to reach me: ... https://saffan.tech, or by email at **saffanali@gmail.com**

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... **https://github.com/safmailas/appsmith_1**, **https://github.com/safmailas/IPN_Hackathon**, **https://github.com/safmailas/Rideshare-App**, and **https://github.com/safmailas/saffan_tech**.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... offline AI use-cases (e.g. healthcare workers in Africa -- see my IPN Hackathon repo!).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ... my repo for a community-driven ridesharing app that works with WhatsApp messaging protocols via a webhook integration. The integration would tap into Whatsapp communities for groups of people to host internal ridesharing services, with privacy, safety, and security. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ... AI agent workflows (_thoughtful_, _intentional_ AI usage in solutions engineering.
- 💬 Ask me about ... I'm skilled in applying cross-functional domains as a means to rapidly iterate ... "quick to ramp" is a skill that happens to emerge as a byproduct of cyclically & iteratively crossing _cross-functional_ with _iterative comprehension_ ... I'm skilled in upskilling cross-functionally.

- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I'm ambidextorous. I use tools with my right: writing, swinging a racket, golf club, fry pan, ... I'm a righty when I _use_ tools to "produce" _something_. In pickleball, the paddle is in my right hand. However, my left-side feels naturally dominant in basketball, football, soccer ball. I throw, yeet, kick, with my left side. I switch stances in a boxing ring like it's second nature to me; probably because that's literally what it is: my right side is _second_ nature. Too many times have I questioned which board stance I preferred - goofy or regular - while riding down black-diamond slopes, hilly streets, and gnarly waves (snow-/skate-/surf- boarding).
  - =>  Can you guess which side I use when I go golfing or shooting?
 
  - _Hint: My clay-disc rangemaster corrected my aim after seeing how I'd just completely whiffed missed my first 5 of 5!_
