- ⚡ Fun fact: ... In Troop 797, I remain to be the youngest adult leader to serve as Scoutmaster! I served for over 3 years. I've seen the Troop on the brink of collapse at the start of the COVID-19 lockdown, and pushed for fun, Scouts-led leadership. The Troop continues to hold the largest number of active Scouts in its region's local area council at over 120 Scouts. I'd say, that my Eagle Rank is prestigious, but my Scoutmaster experience is priceless.
